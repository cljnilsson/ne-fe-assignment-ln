## NE Frontend Demo

### Running
* npm install
* npm run dev

### Confirmed Features
* Fetch list of books
* Search by text
* sort by name/price (one direction only)
* View detailed book info by clicking on card
* Pagination


### Bugs
* The totalItems returns from the API seems unstable, I don't know why it returns a different number of books sometimes but it results in pagination being unreliable
